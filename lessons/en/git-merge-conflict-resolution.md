# Resolve Git merge conflicts manually (best practice)

> English translation of `lessons/contrib/git-merge-conflict-resolution.md`

## Problem

`git pull` / `git merge` / `git rebase` stops with CONFLICT. Files contain standard conflict markers. Unclear which side to keep.

## Root Cause

Two branches edited the same region. Git cannot auto-merge; a human or careful agent must choose or combine changes.

## Solution

```bash
git status
# open each unmerged file, edit out conflict markers
git add path/to/fixed-file
# if merging:
git commit
# if rebasing:
git rebase --continue
```

Rules of thumb:

1. Prefer the change that preserves tests and intent of both sides when possible.
2. After resolving, run the project test/lint command before push.
3. Abort with `git merge --abort` or `git rebase --abort` if lost.

```bash
# list conflicted files only
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

## Verification

```bash
git status   # no Unmerged paths
git diff --check
# run tests
```

## Notes

- Rebase rewrites history on feature branches; do not rebase shared main without coordination.
- For agent PRs: resolve conflicts against upstream/main before force-push.
