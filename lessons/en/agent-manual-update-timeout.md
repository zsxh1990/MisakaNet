# Agent framework update timeout — manual recovery steps

> English translation / structured rewrite of `lessons/contrib/agent-manual-update-timeout.md`

## Problem

Built-in agent update commands hang or time out (slow mirror, flaky network, large download). Automatic self-update never finishes; the agent stays on a broken version.

## Root Cause

Update paths often pull large packages without a tight timeout, fallback mirror, or offline bundle. One stalled TCP connection blocks the whole upgrade.

## Solution

1. Cancel the stuck update (Ctrl+C / kill the updater PID).
2. Switch registry/mirror if applicable (npm, pip, gh release CDN).
3. Retry with a longer timeout or smaller channel (stable vs nightly).
4. As last resort, reinstall from a known-good release tarball.

```bash
# example: pip tool with timeout
pip install --upgrade --default-timeout=100 "some-agent-cli"

# example: npm
npm config set fetch-timeout 120000
npm update -g some-agent
```

Document the working version pin in the project:

```bash
some-agent --version
echo "pinned: $(some-agent --version)" >> ops/VERSIONS.md
```

## Verification

```bash
some-agent --version
# smoke command that failed before the upgrade
```

## Notes

- Prefer pinned versions in production agents; auto-update is optional.
- Corporate networks may need HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY — set them before retrying.
