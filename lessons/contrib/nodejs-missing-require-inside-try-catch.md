## Problem

Missing `require("node:os")` inside a `try/catch(_){}` block silently kills the entire Windows code path. `os.tmpdir()` throws `ReferenceError`, which is caught by the blanket catch handler, the handler never spawns, and tests fail with a cryptic "marker: not found" error.

The `catch(_)` pattern is intentional fire-and-forget but masks real import bugs — the error is swallowed without logging.

## Root Cause

The code uses a blanket `try/catch(_){}` for fire-and-forget process spawning:

```javascript
try {
  const os = require("node:os"); // <-- BUG: this require is INSIDE the try
  const tmpDir = os.tmpdir();
  const marker = path.join(tmpDir, "marker.txt");
  // spawn handler...
} catch (_) {
  // Swallows ALL errors, including ReferenceError from missing require
}
```

When `require("node:os")` is missing or misplaced:
1. `os` is `undefined` (or the require itself throws if the module path is wrong)
2. `os.tmpdir()` throws `ReferenceError: os is not defined`
3. The catch block swallows the error silently
4. The spawn never happens
5. Downstream code waiting for the marker file times out with "marker: not found"

The real import bug is invisible because the catch block does not log or re-throw.

## Solution

### Option A: Import modules at top level (preferred)

Move all `require` statements outside the try/catch block. Module resolution happens once at load time, not inside the hot path:

```javascript
const os = require("node:os");
const path = require("node:path");

// Now try/catch only wraps the spawn logic
try {
  const tmpDir = os.tmpdir();
  const marker = path.join(tmpDir, "marker.txt");
  // spawn handler...
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Spawn failed:", err.message);
}
```

### Option B: Narrow the try/catch scope

If the try/catch must wrap everything, at minimum log the error:

```javascript
try {
  const os = require("node:os");
  const tmpDir = os.tmpdir();
  // spawn...
} catch (err) {
  // Do NOT silently swallow — at minimum log it
  console.error("Fire-and-forget spawn failed:", err);
}
```

### Option C: Use optional import with explicit fallback

```javascript
let tmpDir;
try {
  const os = require("node:os");
  tmpDir = os.tmpdir();
} catch {
  tmpDir = "/tmp"; // fallback for environments where node:os is unavailable
}
```

## Key Points

1. **Blanket `catch(_)` swallows ReferenceError from missing imports.** If a module is required inside a try/catch, a missing or mistyped require becomes invisible.
2. **Import at top level.** All `require()` / `import` statements should be at module scope so missing modules fail immediately at load time with a clear error.
3. **Never use bare `catch(_)` without logging.** Even for fire-and-forget patterns, log the error to a debug channel at minimum.
4. **Cryptic downstream errors often point to swallowed upstream errors.** "marker: not found" means the process never ran, not that the file is missing.
5. **The `node:` prefix requires Node.js 16+.** `require("node:os")` is equivalent to `require("os")` but makes the core-module intent explicit.
