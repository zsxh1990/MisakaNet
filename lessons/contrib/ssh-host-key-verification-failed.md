## Problem

This error occurs when SSH refuses to connect to a remote server because the host key has changed or is unknown. The connection fails with:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Offending ED25519 key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts:3
Host key verification failed.
```

This failure happens when trying to SSH into a server that was previously connected to but has been reinstalled or reconfigured, or when connecting to a new server for the first time in strict mode.

## Root Cause

SSH maintains a file `~/.ssh/known_hosts` that stores the public host keys of every server you connect to. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. The error appears in two scenarios:

1. **Host key changed**: The remote server was reinstalled or its SSH keys regenerated. The stored key in `known_hosts` no longer matches.
2. **Host unknown**: The server is not in `known_hosts` at all, and `StrictHostKeyChecking` is set to `yes`.

## Solution

**1. Remove the old host key (for changed keys)**
```bash
ssh-keygen -R hostname.example.com
```
Replace `hostname.example.com` with the actual server hostname or IP address.

Alternatively, edit `~/.ssh/known_hosts` manually and delete the offending line.

**2. Connect again**
```bash
ssh user@hostname.example.com
```
SSH will prompt you to accept the new host key. Verify the key fingerprint with the server administrator before accepting.

**3. For new servers in automation scripts**
Temporarily disable strict checking (not recommended for production):
```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@hostname.example.com
```

Better approach: add the host key to `known_hosts` non-interactively:
```bash
ssh-keyscan -H hostname.example.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

**4. Verify host key fingerprint**
```bash
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
```
Compare the output with the fingerprint shown during SSH connection.

**5. Check the known_hosts file**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keygen -F hostname.example.com  # search for a specific host
```

## Verification


```bash
git status
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/health
python3 scripts/search_knowledge.py "test query"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
On branch main
OK
Found
```
## Notes

- Always verify host key fingerprints with the server administrator before accepting
- The warning about a changed host key could indicate a man-in-the-middle attack — investigate before proceeding
- Use `ssh-keyscan` in provisioning scripts to pre-populate `known_hosts`
- Different key types (RSA, ECDSA, ED25519) each have separate entries in `known_hosts`
