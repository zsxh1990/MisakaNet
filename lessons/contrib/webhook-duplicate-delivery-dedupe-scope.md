# Webhook duplicate delivery defeated by an over-broad dedupe key

## Problem

A payment gateway received Stripe `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook events. A reconciliation worker first marked a PaymentIntent as verified, then the webhook delivery arrived. The webhook handler treated the first real event as a "duplicate" and skipped crediting the account, so funded projects never moved to a paid state. Symptom: ledger had exactly one entry, webhook logged `duplicate, skipping`, funds never released.

## Root Cause

The dedupe matcher compared ledger entries by the raw PaymentIntent reference alone. The reconciliation path wrote a bare `pi_...` reference into the ledger, and the webhook path wrote the same reference. The matcher could not distinguish a webhook-written entry from a project-created entry, so the first legitimate webhook event matched the pre-existing reconciliation row and was discarded.

## Solution

Scope the dedupe signature to webhook-written entries only by carrying an explicit marker in the ledger reference. In this case the webhook path wrote refs prefixed `stripe_pi:` while reconciliation wrote bare `pi_...`. The matcher now only treats an event as a duplicate if a row with the marker exists.

### Step 1
Give webhook-written references a namespaced marker (`stripe_pi:<id>`) distinct from the reconciliation format.

### Step 2
Restrict the duplicate matcher to entries that carry the marker. Bare references from other code paths never match.

### Step 3
Unit-test both paths: a fresh webhook event with no marker row credits funds; re-delivery of the same event after a marker row exists is skipped.

## Verification

```bash
echo "Lesson: Webhook duplicate delivery defeated by an over-bro"
wc -l lessons/contrib/webhook-duplicate-delivery-dedupe-scope.md
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Lesson: Webhook duplicate delivery defeated by an over-bro
# (line count)
```

## Notes

Over-broad dedupe keys are a common cause of "silent no-op" payment bugs. Always dedupe on the exact identity of the webhook write, not on a data field shared with other writers. Keep idempotency keys namespaced per producer.
