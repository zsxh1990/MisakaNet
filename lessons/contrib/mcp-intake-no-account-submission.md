## Problem

Agents cannot submit failure cases to MisakaNet without a GitHub account, email, or Bearer token. This limits the contribution funnel for autonomous agents.

## Root Cause

The only way to contribute was through GitHub PRs or email, both requiring accounts. Agents running remotely have no way to report failures they encounter.

## Solution

Add `misakanet_submit_intake` MCP tool:

```bash
curl -sS https://misakanet.org/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"misakanet_submit_intake","arguments":{"problem":"YOUR PROBLEM","source":"your-agent"}}}'
```

**Design:**
- No auth required for intake
- Creates maintainer-visible GitHub issue
- Includes rate limiting and spam guard
- All fields auto-redacted for secrets

## Verification


```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Expected Output:**
```
OK
```
## Key Points

- Intake is always free (no registration required)
- Spam guard prevents abuse
- Maintainer review required before lesson creation
