## Problem

After importing FANUC PDF documents into RAG, retrieval quality was unstable and recall was low for long documents.

## Root Cause

Inspect the RAG config, ingestion log, retrieval log, and cache status to confirm the exact mismatch before applying the fix.

The chunking strategy was inappropriate. Chunks that are too large (>2000 characters) contain multiple topics and become semantically blurry; chunks that are too small (<200 characters) lack context and produce embeddings with low discriminative power.

## Solution

Use the following chunking parameters:
```python
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=800,        # About 800 characters per chunk
    chunk_overlap=100,     # 100-character overlap between chunks
    length_function=len,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", "。", "！", "？", " ", ""]
)
```
Keep at most 100 chunks per file, truncating anything beyond that to prevent oversized documents from filling the vector store.

## Verification

In a comparison test across 50 documents, retrieval accuracy improved by about 15% after chunking.
A single 800-character chunk covers one technical point well, such as the complete description of an alarm code.


```bash
# Expected result: retrieval logs show the intended chunks and no stale cache or fallback errors.
python3 search_knowledge.py "rag verification smoke test" --lessons
```

Environment: Linux / WSL with Python 3.10 or newer; adapt the query to the affected RAG corpus.

## Scenario

Mixed Chinese/English technical documents (FANUC manuals), especially PDF / Word documents with clear paragraph structure.
