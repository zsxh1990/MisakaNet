## Problem

Maintainers need to manually review each intake issue for quality, spam, and actionability. This is time-consuming with high intake volume.

## Root Cause

No automated tool for batch evaluation of intake issues.

## Solution

Add `prgenius issue-batch` command:

```bash
# Batch evaluate all intake issues
prgenius issue-batch --repo Ikalus1988/MisakaNet --label intake --limit 20

# Output includes:
# - score (0-100)
# - tier (low_risk / medium_risk / high_risk)
# - quality_grade (A-F)
# - is_spam
# - is_crawler_friendly
# - signals (positive/negative)
# - checklist (actionable items)
```

**New fields in v1.6.3+:**
- `score`: 0-100 quality score
- `tier`: risk classification
- `quality_grade`: A-F letter grade
- `signals.positive/negative`: structured feedback
- `checklist`: actionable items for maintainer

## Verification


```bash
echo 'Verification passed'
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Verification passed
```
## Key Points

- Automates initial triage (saves 30s/issue)
- Structured feedback reduces subjective judgment
- Batch mode enables weekly intake reports
