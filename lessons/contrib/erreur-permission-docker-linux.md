## Problem

This error occurs when a non-root user tries to run Docker commands on Linux without proper group membership. Every `docker` command fails with:

```
docker: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

The failure happens even though Docker is installed correctly and the service is running (`sudo systemctl status docker` shows `active (running)`).

## Root Cause

Docker creates the socket `/var/run/docker.sock` with `root:root` ownership by default. The current user is not in the `docker` group and therefore lacks read/write permissions on the socket.

Two approaches exist: prefix every command with `sudo` (not recommended) or add the user to the `docker` group (recommended).

## Solution

**1. Check if the docker group exists**
```bash
grep docker /etc/group
```
If the group does not exist, create it:
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

**2. Add your user to the docker group**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**3. Activate the group change**
Log out and log back in, or run:
```bash
newgrp docker
```

**4. Verify the fix**
```bash
docker ps
```

**5. (Optional) Restart the Docker service**
If the error persists after the steps above:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Verification


```bash
docker ps
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Expected Output:**
```
CONTAINER ID
OK
```
## Notes

- Adding a user to the `docker` group grants equivalent to `root` access on the Docker socket — be aware of this security implication
- In production environments, use registry authentication and avoid granting Docker access to untrusted users
- On WSL2, Docker Desktop manages permissions automatically; this error typically appears with a native Docker Engine installation
- The `newgrp` command only affects the current terminal session — a full logout/login is required for persistence
