## Background

A vertical-domain RAG knowledge base (190+ PDFs, 200K+ vectors) was already online, supporting natural-language Q&A and daily automated inspections. However, issues found by inspections still had to be handled manually, so the whole loop lacked automation:

- Inspection failure → manually summarize into a badcase document → manually send to AI for repair
- No feedback channel when users are dissatisfied
- The synonym expansion table is empty, so some terms cannot be retrieved
- No queue management, making review progress untraceable

## Root Cause

Inspect the RAG config, ingestion log, retrieval log, and cache status to confirm the exact mismatch before applying the fix.

The "flywheel" in the design document only covered the first half:

- The daily inspection concept exists (`daily_audit` is planned)
- Wrong-question aggregation exists (badcase records)
- But the self-learning module (`kb_learning.py`), review tool (`badcase_review.py`), and synonym file (`synonyms.json`) are all missing
- The code has imports but silently degrades with try/except, and the files were never created

## Solution

Implement a four-layer closed loop, where each layer can work independently:

### Layer 1: Synonym Expansion (`synonyms.json`)
- Create an independent JSON file with 32 groups of vertical-domain synonyms (alarms/servo/zero calibration/encoder, etc.)
- `rag_core.py` already has `_load_synonyms()`, which hot-loads incrementally by mtime
- Convention: keys that start with `_` are metadata and are filtered out; all other entries are automatically used by `expand_query()`

### Layer 2: Self-Learning Engine (`kb_learning.py`)
- `log_query(query, top_score, chunks_count)` matches the existing call in `rag_core.py`
- Automatically classify badcase thresholds: top_score < 0.45 is failure level; < 0.6 is warning level; chunks_count == 0 is empty retrieval
- Write to a JSONL queue file (`badcase_pending.jsonl`) with append support
- Provide approve/reject operations; approved items move to the approved queue and rejected items move to the rejected queue

### Layer 3: Daily Inspection (`daily_audit.py`)
- Stratified sample 7 questions from a 200-question bank (2 L2 + 5 L3, stratified by tag)
- Call the RAG API for live checks: keyword hits, minimum answer length, brand contamination, semantic gap
- Output a JSON report + Markdown summary + automatically append to `badcase_pending`
- `--cron` mode is for crontab, and the exit code reflects pass-rate status

### Layer 4: Review Tool (`badcase_review.py`)
- Five atomic CLI operations: list / show / approve / reject / auto
- `auto` automatically approves high-confidence badcases (empty retrieval, score < 0.3, "low-quality retrieval" features)
- Shares the same JSONL queue files with `kb_learning`

### Additional: IM Feedback Collection (WeChat Bot)
- Intercept "good" and "bad" feedback in the existing wxauto bot
- Track each user's previous question and associate feedback with the original query
- Call `kb_learning.add_feedback()` to write into the queue

## Verification

```bash
grep -i 'bm25\|chunk\|embed' lessons/contrib/rag-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -3
echo Search verified
```

**Expected Output:**
```
# (refs)
Search verified
```

## File Structure

```
project_root/
  synonyms.json            Synonym table (auto-loaded by rag_core)
  kb_learning.py           Self-learning engine
  daily_audit.py           Daily inspection
  badcase_review.py        Review CLI
  audit_reports/
    badcase_pending.jsonl   Pending review queue
    badcase_approved.jsonl  Approved
    badcase_rejected.jsonl  Rejected
    audit_YYYY-MM-DD.json   Daily report
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **JSONL instead of SQLite**: Queue files need to be read/written/edited by humans; JSONL is more transparent than SQLite
2. **Command mode instead of a daemon**: Review is a low-frequency operation, and a CLI is simpler and more reliable than a background service
3. **Layer independence**: Each layer can run independently; `rag_core`'s dependency on `kb_learning` is optional with try/except degradation
4. **Shared review queue files**: `daily_audit` and `add_feedback()` write to the same pending file, and `badcase_review` manages them centrally
