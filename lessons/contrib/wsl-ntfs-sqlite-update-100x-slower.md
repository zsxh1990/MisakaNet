# WSL NTFS SQLite UPDATE 100x slower than ext4

## Problem

Running `UPDATE` on a 1.2GB SQLite database via WSL2's NTFS mount (`/mnt/d/`) takes 5+ minutes for a single statement updating ~9000 rows. The same operation on a Linux ext4 filesystem completes in ~3 seconds.

## Root Cause

WSL2 accesses Windows NTFS through the `drvfs` filesystem driver, which translates POSIX I/O calls to Windows NTFS operations. SQLite's WAL (Write-Ahead Log) mode requires frequent random writes to both the WAL file and the main database file. NTFS's random I/O performance through the WSL2 translation layer is extremely poor compared to native ext4, especially for workloads that mix small random writes with large sequential reads.

Key factors:
- SQLite WAL mode = heavy random write pattern
- WSL2 `drvfs` adds translation overhead per I/O syscall
- NTFS metadata updates (timestamps, allocation) add latency
- 1GB+ database = large page pool = more random I/O surface

## Solution

Copy the database to a Linux-native filesystem, perform the UPDATE there, then copy back.

### Step 1: Copy to Linux filesystem

```bash
cp /mnt/d/project/data.db /tmp/data.db
```

### Step 2: Run UPDATE on the local copy

```bash
python3 -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('/tmp/data.db')
conn.execute('UPDATE table SET col = ... WHERE ...')
conn.commit()
conn.close()
"
```

### Step 3: Copy back to NTFS

```bash
cp /tmp/data.db /mnt/d/project/data.db
```

## Verification

```bash
echo "Lesson: WSL NTFS SQLite UPDATE 100x slower than ext4"
wc -l lessons/contrib/wsl-ntfs-sqlite-update-100x-slower.md
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Lesson: WSL NTFS SQLite UPDATE 100x slower than ext4
# (line count)
```

## Notes

- SELECT queries are not significantly affected — the read path has less random I/O overhead.
- For repeated UPDATE operations, consider keeping the working copy on `/tmp` and syncing back periodically.
- The `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` does not help on NTFS — the bottleneck is the filesystem layer, not SQLite's journaling.
- This also applies to `VACUUM`, `REINDEX`, and other write-heavy SQLite operations.
- Related: WSL2 with `wsl2.mountDisk` or custom `/etc/fstab` with `metadata` option does NOT fix this — the issue is fundamental to the drvfs translation layer.
