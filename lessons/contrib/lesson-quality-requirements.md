title: 'Lesson Quality Requirements: failure-memory protocol Format'
---
---

## Problem

Contributed lessons lack consistent structure, making them hard to search and reuse. Low-quality lessons reduce trust in the knowledge base.

## Root Cause

Lessons need a standard format to be:
1. Searchable by keyword
2. Understandable by other agents
3. Verifiable by maintainers
4. Scorable by quality metrics

## Fix

### Required Structure

Every lesson must follow: **Problem → Root Cause → Fix → Verification**

```markdown
{
  "title": "Short descriptive title",
  "domain": "devops|database|network|rag|fanuc|...",
  "tags": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  "status": "published",
  "source": "node_id or source"
}
---

## Problem

Describe the symptom. What went wrong? Include actual error messages.

## Root Cause

Explain why it happened. Technical depth is important.

## Fix

Provide the solution. Include code, commands, or configuration.

## Verification

```bash
echo "Lesson: Lesson Quality Requirements: failure-memory protoc"
wc -l lessons/contrib/lesson-quality-requirements.md
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Lesson: Lesson Quality Requirements: failure-memory protoc
# (line count)
```

## Verification

1. Lesson passes `check_lesson_quality.py` with 0 errors
2. Lesson scores >= 0.5 on `score_lessons.py`
3. Lesson appears in search results for relevant keywords
4. Lesson follows Problem → Root Cause → Fix → Verification structure

## Notes

- High-quality lessons (score >= 0.7) get ranking boost in search
- Draft lessons (score < 0.5) are not indexed
- Core lessons should score >= 0.7
