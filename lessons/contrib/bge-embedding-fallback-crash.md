## Problem

When HermesHub starts, if the BGE-m3 model has not been downloaded to the local path, SkillIndexer crashes immediately.
The local path is hard-coded as `~/.cache/huggingface/...`, which does not exist on other machines.

## Root Cause

Inspect the RAG config, ingestion log, retrieval log, and cache status to confirm the exact mismatch before applying the fix.

`_init_embedding_model()` in `skill_indexer.py` loads the model with `local_files_only=True`, and the model path is a hard-coded machine-specific absolute path. There is no fallback mechanism and no environment-variable override.

## Solution

1. Remove the hard-coded absolute path and use: constructor parameter → `EMBEDDING_MODEL_PATH` environment variable → model name (auto-download)
2. Wrap loading failures in try/except and degrade to no-embedding mode (`register_skill` skips semantic deduplication)
3. Make `_generate_embedding()` return an empty list, so `search_skills` falls back to keyword matching

## Verification

Start the hub on a machine without the BGE-m3 model. It does not crash and prints "[Embedding] degraded mode — semantic deduplication and search will be unavailable".


```bash
# Expected result: retrieval logs show the intended chunks and no stale cache or fallback errors.
python3 search_knowledge.py "rag verification smoke test" --lessons
```

Environment: Linux / WSL with Python 3.10 or newer; adapt the query to the affected RAG corpus.

## Scenario

Any non-development Node machine (Node 1/2/3/6) without a pre-downloaded BGE-m3 model cache.
