# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Identify and remove signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound natural and human. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide (maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup), derived from observations of thousands of AI-generated text instances.

**Key insight:** LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely completion, which is how the telltale patterns below get baked in.

## When to use this skill

Load this skill whenever the user asks to:
- "humanize", "de-AI", "de-slop", or "un-ChatGPT" a piece of text
- rewrite something so it doesn't sound like it was written by an LLM
- edit a draft (blog post, essay, PR description, docs, memo, email, tweet, resume bullet) to sound more natural
- match their voice in writing they're producing
- review text for AI tells before publishing

Also apply this skill to **your own** output when writing user-facing prose — release notes, PR descriptions, documentation, long-form explanations, summaries. Hermes's baseline voice already strips most of these, but a focused pass catches what slips through.

## How to use it in Hermes

The text usually arrives one of three ways:
1. **Inline** — user pastes the text directly into the message. Work on it in-place, reply with the rewrite.
2. **File** — user points at a file. Use `read_file` to load it, then `patch` or `write_file` to apply edits. For markdown docs in a repo, a targeted `patch` per section is cleaner than rewriting the whole file.
3. **Voice calibration sample** — user provides an additional sample of their own writing (inline or by file path) and asks you to match it. Read the sample first, then rewrite. See the Voice Calibration section below.

Always show the rewrite to the user. For file edits, show a diff or the changed section — don't silently overwrite.

## Your task

When given text to humanize:

1. **Identify AI patterns** — scan for the 29 patterns listed below.
2. **Rewrite problematic sections** — replace AI-isms with natural alternatives.
3. **Preserve meaning** — keep the core message intact.
4. **Maintain voice** — match the intended tone (formal, casual, technical, etc.). If a voice sample was provided, match it specifically.
5. **Add soul** — don't just remove bad patterns, inject actual personality. See PERSONALITY AND SOUL below.
6. **Do a final anti-AI pass** — ask yourself: "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?" Answer briefly with any remaining tells, then revise one more time.


## Voice Calibration (optional)

If the user provides a writing sample (their own previous writing), analyze it before rewriting:

1. **Read the sample first.** Note:
   - Sentence length patterns (short and punchy? Long and flowing? Mixed?)
   - Word choice level (casual? academic? somewhere between?)
   - How they start paragraphs (jump right in? Set context first?)
   - Punctuation habits (lots of dashes? Parenthetical asides? Se
