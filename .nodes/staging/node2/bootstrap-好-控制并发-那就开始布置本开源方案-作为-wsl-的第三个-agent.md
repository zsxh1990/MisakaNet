Now I have a clear picture. Let me compile the memory usage:

**Current WSL RSS breakdown:**
- `openclaw-gateway` (python3): 527 MB

The user wants to deploy cc-haha as the third agent in WSL. Let me plan this out:

2. Install dependencies (Node.js)
3. Configure API keys (Anthropic/MiniMax)
4. Set up as a systemd service (like OpenClaw)
5. Integrate with task board
